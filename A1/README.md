 INSTRUCTIONS:
 • This program is a Demo Banking Application with a Loans Module to showcase the process of Test Driven Development
 • To run the program in the main flow, just execute --> javac *.java --> java Main
 • To run the program in the test flow, just execute --> javac *.java --> java Main test
 • The program is shipped with all test cases passing by default
 • The test cases can be manipulated to produce different outcomes by playing around with the hardcoded values
 • A few private methods such as the presentation layer methods to drive the menu, derived methods to validate data have not got 1:1 test case mapping as they are either tested by the caller methods or can't be tested automatically
 • A fair bit of hardcoding and bad coding practices (returning hard coded strings instead of constants, poor error handling, etc) have been applied due to time constraints
 • Note: Java version 17 or higher is required to compile this program succesfully (Java 18 is preferred)
